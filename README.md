# Predicting-Oil-Production-with-Regression-Analysis

This repository houses a predictive model for forecasting oil production that employs supervised regression techniques. The primary objective of this project is to train the model using historical oil production data and identify the various factors that impact oil production, such as drilling activity, oil price, and weather conditions.

The model employs several supervised regression algorithms, including linear regression, decision tree regression, and random forest regression, to make future oil production predictions. The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared.
This model has broad potential, including use by oil and gas companies, investors, and researchers for forecasting future oil production and making data-driven decisions. Additionally, the model can be enhanced to incorporate additional features and data sources to further improve its predictive accuracy.
